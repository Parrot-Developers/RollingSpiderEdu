# RollingSpiderEdu
Rolling Spider software package for Education

### Parrot_customFirmware
... contains files and a quick start manual for Parrot's custom firmware that opens up interfaces to implement custom estimation, control and image processing algorithms on Parrot's Rolling Spider drone.

### MIT_MatlabToolbox
... contains MIT's Rolling Spider Matlab Toolbox ROSMAT that builds around Parrot's custom firmware and let's you design and simulate estimation and control algorithms for the Rolling Spider in MATLAB/Simulink and autogenerates embedded c-code that you can use to actually fly the drone. It was initially developed to enhance the learning experience of introductory control and estimation-related classes.  Please refer to [MIT_MatlabToolbox/README.md](https://github.com/Parrot-Developers/RollingSpiderEdu/blob/master/MIT_MatlabToolbox/README.md) for more information.
